        <h2>So, what is an e-book, anyway?</h2>
        <p>An e-book is a lot like the books that you would find on our Library’s shelves, but in electronic format. E-books can be read on your phone, tablet, computer, or e-reader. Search for them in our catalogue, the same way you would regular books, or via specific tools in our E-Library.</p>

        <h2>E-Book benefits</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>1. Save a trip to the Library</strong><br>
            There’s no doubt that the Library is a wonderful place to visit, but you won’t have to go very far to borrow e-books. Once your e-book is available, you can download it 24 hours of the day, any day of the year, all from the comfort of your own home.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>2. No late fees</strong><br>
            Your e-books will automatically return themselves after your loan period, and, the best part is, you’ll never have to worry about late fees.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>3. Read anytime, anywhere</strong><br>
            If you enjoy reading on the go, you can take your whole library with you—on the bus, train, or airplane; or even to stand in line at the grocery store.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>4. One device, many books</strong><br>
            If you’re not sure which book to pack, e-books eliminate the need to choose one book over another to carry with you. E-books are portable and lightweight, making it easy to carry around 100s, even 1000s, of books at once on your mobile device, tablet, e-reader, or laptop.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>5. A dictionary at your fingertips</strong><br>
            With many e-books, you can use the built-in dictionary feature to define an unfamiliar word. On most devices, you can do this by pressing and holding the word you'd like to look up.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>6. Search in seconds</strong><br>
            With many e-books, you have the ability to search through an entire book in seconds. Easily search for information in an e-book, instead of turning page after page to find what you’re looking for.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>7. Customize how you read</strong><br>
            When you’re reading an e-book, you can adjust the text size to be as small or as large as you’d like. You’ll also have options to adjust other settings, such as margins, line spacing, font style, brightness, and much more.
